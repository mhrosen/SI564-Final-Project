1) Created database, tables, and Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) from the “Movies on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+” open-source data set with MySQL in Jupyter Command Line and Data Grip environments. 

2) Constructed letter from CEO of fictitious company where I work containing 10 complicated SQL questions. Answering questions invokes skills ranging from normalizing tables to retrieving calculations and filtered records. The ultimate goal is to select a partnering movie platform to promote our services and answer the CEO’s personal movie inquiries. 

3) Queried database and crafted a formal email response to the CEO.
