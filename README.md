# SI564-Final-Project

Created database, tables, and Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) from the “Movies on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+” open-source data set with MySQL in Jupyter Command Line and Data Grip environments. 

Constructed letter from fictitious CEO of my company asking 10 complicated SQL questions, invoking skills ranging from normalizing tables to retrieving calculations and filtered records, in order to select a partnering movie platform to promote our services and answer the CEO’s personal movie inquiries. 

Queried database and crafted a formal email response to the CEO.
